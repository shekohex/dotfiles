## Setup

* Install starship

* To Install most of my programs and get the same setup I made a `pkglist` file
that contains most of programs that I'm using.

Now I assume you are running an Arch Linux based system.
if not, you can open the pkglist and install the equivalent packages for your system.

So, to continue, first install `paru` which will help us install other programs and packages.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git /tmp/paru
cd /tmp/paru
makepkg -si
```

Then Simply after going through each package from the list you simply do:

`paru -S - < .pkglist` and you are ready to go!.
